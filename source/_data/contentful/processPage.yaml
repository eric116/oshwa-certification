  page_title: The Certification Process
  header_copy: This guide is intended to be used as a reference to best practices
    to ensure that your projects are following the definition of Open Source Hardware
    that OSHWA requires
  summary: "This guide is intended to give you instruction in how to ensure your project
    is both legally open for downstream use and so you can better understand what
    level of intellectual property protection applies to each of the common elements
    found in open source hardware projects.\n\nUnlike open source software, which
    is generally protected by copyright law, many elements of open source hardware
    are more difficult to protect from copying and may be impossible to protect from
    misuse at all. \n\nThe product examples included here are only meant to serve
    as illustrative demonstrations of the concepts being discussed. These descriptions
    do not reflect a legal opinion of OSHWA or the companies referenced."
  description: "After completing this guide, you will have the knowledge to self-certify
    your product as OSHWA-compliant open source hardware. This allows users to know
    that the definition of “open source hardware” used by a specific project matches
    the community definition.  \n\nThe OSHWA certification mark can only be used by
    projects that comply with the community definition. Completing the certification
    creates a legally binding and unique logo that can only be used by projects that
    comply with the community definition of open source hardware."
