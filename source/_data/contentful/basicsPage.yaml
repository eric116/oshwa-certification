  header_copy: Interested in building your own hardware projects? Customizing other
    projects? Have new ideas you want to share with the world? Open source hardware
    may be for you. Learn about the basics of open source hardware.
  section1: |-
    Open Source Hardware (OSHW) is a term for tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things — whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, distribute, and use those things. This definition is intended to help provide guidelines for the development and evaluation of licenses for Open Source Hardware.

    Hardware is different from software in that physical resources must always be committed for the creation of physical goods. Accordingly, persons or companies producing items (“products”) under an OSHW license have an obligation to make it clear that such products are not manufactured, sold, warrantied, or otherwise sanctioned by the original designer and also not to make use of any trademarks owned by the original designer.
  section2: Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available
    so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware
    based on that design. The hardware’s source, the design from which it is made,
    is available in the preferred format for making modifications to it. Ideally,
    open source hardware uses readily-available components and materials, standard
    processes, open infrastructure, unrestricted content, and open-source design tools
    to maximize the ability of individuals to make and use hardware. Open source hardware
    gives people the freedom to control their technology while sharing knowledge and
    encouraging commerce through the open exchange of designs.
  section3: "There are four “elements” of an open source hardware project. Not all
    projects will have all of these elements, and some may have features that do not
    fall neatly within these categories. \n\nBroadly speaking, the __four main elements__
    of an open source hardware project are:\n\n__Hardware__ - The physical functional
    components/elements of the product (i.e. the product itself) (required)\n__Software__
    - Any code, firmware, or software involved in product’s function\n__Documentation__
    - Design files, schematics, instructions, etc. (required)\n__Branding__ - Brand
    names, product names, logos, and product designs (optional, but recommended)"
  section4: Hardware developers who meet the requirements for making their projects
    open source may self-certify their projects as OSHWA-compliant open source hardware.
    This allows users to know that the definition of “open source hardware” used by
    a specific project matches the community definition. The OSHWA certification mark
    can only be used by projects that comply with the community definition. Completing
    the certification creates a legally binding and unique logo that can only be used
    by projects that comply with the community definition of open source hardware.
