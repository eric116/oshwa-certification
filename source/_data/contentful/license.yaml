  license_description: |-
    A CC 0 license is the most permissive option, which lets downstream users use your product documentation for any purpose without any limits. This license relinquishes any claim you may have over ownership of the product documentation.

    This means that other open source hardware makers may use your product in way they see fit, as long as it confirms to the OSHWA Definition.

    *Other open copyright licenses may be acceptable under the OSHWA definition. We recommend Creative Commons, however, due to its widespread acceptance, recognition, and ease of use.*

    *The use of any CC “NonCommercial (NC)” and “NoDerivatives (ND)” licenses are not permissible under the OSHWA Definition.*
