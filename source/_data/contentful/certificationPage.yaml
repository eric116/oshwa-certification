  page_title: Certify a Project
  header_copy: The purpose of this certification is to provide an easy and straightforward
    way for producers to indicate that their products meet a uniform and well-defined
    standard for open-source compliance, benefiting both creators and consumers of
    these products
  description: Hardware developers who meet the requirements for making their projects
    open source may self-certify their projects as OSHWA-compliant open source hardware.
    This allows users to know that the definition of “open source hardware” used by
    a specific project matches the community definition. The OSHWA certification mark
    can only be used by projects that comply with the community definition. Completing
    the certification creates a legally binding and unique logo that can only be used
    by projects that comply with the community definition of open source hardware.
