    Have you made your original design files publicly available?

    Have you made your any auxiliary design files publicly available? (optional)

    Have you made a bill of materials publicly available? (optional)

    Have you made photos of your product at various stages of assembly publicly available? (optional)

    Have you made any instructions or other explanations publicly available? (optional)

    Have you made your product documentation publicly available through GitHub or a similar platform?

    Have you reviewed Creative Commons licensing instructions and properly applied a CC license to your files?
  about_description: "All OSHWA-certified hardware must provide “documentation including
    design files, and must allow modification and distribution of the design files”
    per the OSHWA Open Source Hardware Definition. The more robust and explanatory
    this documentation is, the better. This is for two reasons:\n\n1. More robust
    documentation makes it easier for downstream users to build, use, and iterate
    on your product. \n2. Robust documentation, especially when paired with creative
    design elements and descriptive text, takes on greater amounts of copyright protectability
    to prevent against misuse. \n\nNote that copyrighted product documentation can
    still be open and easily usable by downstream users. But stronger copyright protection
    for product documentation makes it easier to attempt to enforce the terms of the
    applied copyright license because opponents will not be able to argue that your
    documentation does not have copyright protection., which would make the license
    useless.\n\nTo ensure that downstream users are free to use your documentation,
    all open source documentation is required to include an open copyright license,
    such as a Creative Commons license. Which CC license you choose is up to you:
    pick the one that most closely aligns with your desires for your project and follow
    the CC guide to sharing your work.\n\nAll written or drawn materials have some
    inherent copyright protection, so long as they are “fixed in a tangible medium.”
    But, the amount of protection copyright offers varies depending on whether the
    materials are purely functional or more creative and artistic.\n\nIt is important
    to note that this protection only means that other creators cannot literally copy
    your design documentation without your permission (which you grant them through
    the CC license). However, it does not stop them from making a physical object
    based on the instructions that the documentation provides or making their own
    version of your documentation.\n\n\n"
  spectrum_description: |-
    Thorough, robust documentation, when paired with creative design elements and descriptive text, takes on greater amounts of copyright protectability to prevent against misuse. Note that copyrighted product documentation can still be open and easily usable by downstream users. The benefit of stronger copyright protections for product documentation is that attempts to enforce the terms of the applied copyright license will be easier, because opponents will not be able to argue that your documentation does not have copyright protection, thus voiding the license. For example, a Creative Common license that requires attribution, known as a CC-BY license, would be effective as applied to copyright protected elements in your documentation. For this reason, it is important to create thorough, robust and creative documentation that has copyrightable elements, to ensure the enforceability of the license.

    All of these product’s documentations are “Open” documentation because they use a Creative Commons (or similar) license to enable downstream users to use the product documentation. But, with regards to protecting against misuse, the schematics towards the left side of the spectrum are less protectable because they are highly functional and less artistic. Both the HackEEG and Sparkfun schematics are almost purely functional, but the Sparkfun logo gives it a small amount of artistic flourish. The Smoothieware Guide and Sparkfun Guide are more protectable because they feature both images and text, which express a greater degree of creative thought and artistic design. The Handibot model is in the middle, because it is largely functional, but the color choices and visual elements do contain a degree of creativity.

    closely aligns with your desires for your project. Please visit the Creative Commons
    website for a full description and explanation of the different CC licenses and
    a guide to their use. Other open copyright licenses may be acceptable under the

    branding_information: SparkFun’s logo and brand name are both protected by registered
      trademarks in the U.S. The “XBee Explorer Serial” product name, while not a
      registered trademark, is also protected by trademark law but to a lesser degree
      (because it is not registered) but it is still a unique product name. Their
      product tutorial is protected by copyright and licensed under a CC license.
      The red circuit board design may offer some trademark protection, because it
      is unique to Sparkfun and not necessary for the functioning of the product.
      The board’s schematic may receive some light protection in its color choices
      and use of logos and the Sparkfun brand name. But, because the circuit board
      itself and hardware on it are purely functional, they would likely receive no
      protection.
  commercialization_description: |-
    More original, robust documentation is likely to have stronger copyright protection, which can prevent against misuse. But, copyright only protects against third parties misusing the product documentation itself, not against making a physical copy of the product by following the documentation instructions.

    The definition of open-source hardware specifies that you must allow modification and commercial re-use of your design, so note that CC licenses with a no-derivatives or non-commercial clause are incompatible with certification.
