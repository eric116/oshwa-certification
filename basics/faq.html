The hardware’s source, the design from which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making modifications to it.”</p><p>We think open source hardware is a great way to share knowledge and facilitate development of new products. We hope this FAQ helps you understand what it’s all about and whether it makes sense for you.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>Why did OSHWA create this certification?</p></dt><dd><p>The Community had raised concerns that the term “open source hardware” was being used to mean different things by different people. While no one owns the term “open source hardware,” the certification makes it easy to identify projects that comply with the specific <a href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/">community definition of open source hardware</a>.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>What does the certification do?</p></dt><dd><p>The certification creates a legally binding and unique logo that can only be used by projects that comply with the community definition of open source hardware. It allows users to know that the definition of “open source hardware” used by a specific project matches the community definition. The OSHWA certification mark can only be used by projects that comply with the community definition.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>What doesn’t the certification do?</p></dt><dd><p>The certification does not limit how people can use the term “open source hardware” or the open gear logo. It has no impact on anyone who interprets “open source hardware” to mean something different than the community definition, nor does it prevent those people from continuing to use the gear logo.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>Can I use non-open components in my open source hardware?</p></dt><dd><p>Yes. While open components are always preferred, today it is not always possible to find all open source components. The concept of the “user contribution” is central to the open source hardware certification process. You must make available every component that it is within your power to make available. If you do not have the power to make the component available (for example, if the patent for the component is held by another party), you are not required to make that component freely available. However, in order to comply with the requirements, the closed component cannot require an NDA for access.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>How does the certification logo related to the open gear logo?</p></dt><dd><p>The two logos are compatible and can be used together. The certification logo is designed to complement the existing open gear logo. The open gear logo has been incredibly successful in raising awareness of open source hardware. However, people have used it to represent a number of different interpretations of what it means to be open source hardware. The certification logo on a piece of hardware means that the hardware complies with the <a href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/">community definition of open source hardware</a> maintained by OSHWA.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>Do I register projects individually?</p></dt><dd><p>Yes. The certification works on a per-project basis. OSHWA does not certify individuals, companies, or organizations as open source hardware-compliant.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>What happens when I have a new version of a registered project?</p></dt><dd><p>You must register each new version of a certified project. This is because the documentation for the new versions will be somewhat different from documentation from previous projects. Registering subsequent versions allows users to track documentation that is relevant to their version of the project. At this time, OSHWA defers to license holders to determine when a set of changes become substantial enough to justify re-registration. As a rule of thumb, re-registration should occur if the documentation for the existing registration would no longer be complete for the current release.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>What happens if I want to remove my project from the registry and/or stop using the certification mark?</p></dt><dd><p>You may stop using the certification mark at any time. However, you may not remove a project from the registry. This is because users of the registered project may still rely on the information in the registry to access documentation and other relevant information. OSHWA may note that a project in the registry is no longer compliant with the terms of the certification program.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>How much does it cost to register?</p></dt><dd><p>Registration is free.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>Can I certify a project before it is publicly launched?</p></dt><dd><p>Yes. You will need to provide links to the final final documentation that you will make available at launch. OSHWA will then review your project and, if appropriate, grant you provisional certification. Once your project is live OSHWA will review the publicly available documentation in order to ensure that it matches the requirements. If the publicly available documentation matches the documentation used during the application process, the provisional certification will become formal certification. Email certification@oshwa.org for details.</p></dd></div><div class="accordion__item js-open-accordion"><dt><p>What if I have a question not addressed by this FAQ?</p></dt><dd><p>Email certification@oshwa.org and we’ll do our best to get you an answer.</p></dd></div></dl></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer"></footer><div class="copyright"></div><div id="overlay" class="js-overlay"></div><script src="/oshwa/vendor/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script><script src="/oshwa/vendor/slick.min.js"></script><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/list.js/1.5.0/list.min.js"></script><script src="/oshwa/assets/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
