This generally requires two steps: 1) making source files, bills of material, and other information about the hardware available to the public so that users understand how the hardware works, and 2) licensing the hardware in a way that allows others to make use of and build upon this information.</p><p>Hardware is different from software in that physical resources must always be committed for the creation of physical goods. Accordingly, persons or companies producing items (“products”) under an OSHW license have an obligation to make it clear that such products are not manufactured, sold, warrantied, or otherwise sanctioned by the original designer and also not to make use of any trademarks owned by the original designer in a way that implies such a relationship.</p></div></div></section><section class="page-section page-section--panel"><div class="row expanded"><div class="column large-9 medium-9 small-12"><h2>Why open source hardware?</h2><p>Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design. The hardware’s source, the design from which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making modifications to it. Ideally, open source hardware uses readily-available components and materials, standard processes, open infrastructure, unrestricted content, and open-source design tools to maximize the ability of individuals to make and use hardware. Open source hardware gives people the freedom to control their technology while sharing knowledge and encouraging commerce through the open exchange of designs.</p></div></div></section><section class="page-section page-section--panel"><div class="row expanded"><div class="column large-9 medium-9 small-12"><h2>How do I make hardware open source?</h2><p>There are four “elements” of an open source hardware project. Not all projects will have all of these elements, and some may have features that do not fall neatly within these categories.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the <strong>four main elements</strong> of an open source hardware project are:</p><ul><li><strong>Hardware</strong> - The physical functional components/elements of the product (i.e. the product itself) (required)</li><li><strong>Software</strong> - Any code, firmware, or software involved in product’s function</li><li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Design files, schematics, instructions, etc. (required)</li><li><strong>Branding</strong> - Brand names, product names, logos, and product designs (optional, but recommended)</li></ul><p>In order for hardware to be considered open source under the OSHWA definition, you must make information about your project publicly available and certify that you have chosen an appropriate open source license for each your hardware, software (if applicable), and documentation.</p><p>Branding can be trademarked and is recommended. Branding does not fall into the scope of opening your source to be considered open source.</p></div></div></section><section class="page-section page-section--panel"><div class="row expanded"><div class="column large-9 medium-9 small-12"><h2>How do I make hardware open source?</h2><p>Hardware developers who meet the requirements for making their projects open source may self-certify their projects as OSHWA-compliant open source hardware. This allows users to know that the definition of “open source hardware” used by a specific project matches the community definition. The OSHWA certification mark can only be used by projects that comply with the community definition. Completing the certification creates a legally binding and unique logo that can only be used by projects that comply with the community definition of open source hardware.</p></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer"></footer><div class="copyright"></div><div id="overlay" class="js-overlay"></div><script src="/oshwa/vendor/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script><script src="/oshwa/vendor/slick.min.js"></script><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/list.js/1.5.0/list.min.js"></script><script src="/oshwa/assets/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
